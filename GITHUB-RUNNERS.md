# GITHUB-RUNNERS.md — how CI reaches this AWS account

How `ejc3` repos get CI into AWS account `928413605543` (us-west-1), and what crosses
the GitHub↔AWS boundary to make it work. Defined in `github-actions.tf`,
`runner-autoscale.tf`, and `runner-vpc.tf`.

**The model:** two integrations, opposite directions of trust. GitHub-hosted runners
reach *into* AWS with **no stored credential** — short-lived OIDC federation. Self-hosted
runners run *inside* AWS on spot metal and reach *back* to GitHub with **one long-lived
secret**, a PAT in SSM. Every resource below belongs to one of those two patterns.

|  | Pattern A — hosted → AWS | Pattern B — self-hosted in AWS |
|--|--|--|
| Repos | `ejc3/aws`, `ejc3/firepod` | `ejc3/fcvm` |
| Runs on | GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` | spot `*.metal` in this account |
| Secret across the boundary | none (federated token) | GitHub PAT + webhook HMAC |
| What it does | Terraform drift, AMI builds, CodeArtifact | KVM/Firecracker CI that needs bare metal |
| Credential lifetime | ~1h STS session | PAT until manually rotated |

## Pattern A — hosted runners reach into AWS with OIDC (keyless)

A GitHub-hosted job authenticates to AWS by presenting an OIDC token GitHub signs for it,
which AWS STS exchanges for a ~1-hour role session. Nothing long-lived is stored on either
side — there is no AWS access key in repo secrets to leak or rotate.

The trust chain:
- **OIDC provider** (`aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.github`) — `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`,
  audience `sts.amazonaws.com`, thumbprint `6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1` pinned.
- **Role** `github-actions-terraform` — assumable only via `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`
  when the token's `aud` is `sts.amazonaws.com` **and** its `sub` matches
  `repo:ejc3/aws:*` or `repo:ejc3/firepod:*`. The `sub` is the only thing tying a given
  GitHub repo to this role.
- **Permissions** on that role: account-wide read-only (`Describe*`/`Get*`/`List*` across
  ec2, iam, s3, cloudwatch, logs, rds, lambda, apigateway, budgets, ses, ssm, backup,
  events, sns, sms-voice); Terraform state on `aws-infrastructure-*-tf-state`; the lock table
  `ejc3-terraform-locks` (`GetItem`/`PutItem`/`DeleteItem`); an AMI-builder block
  (`RunInstances`, `Stop`/`TerminateInstances`, `CreateImage`, `CreateTags`, `Register`/`DeregisterImage`);
  `iam:PassRole` on `jumpbox-admin-role`; and CodeArtifact read + publish.

The consumer is `.github/workflows/drift.yml` — daily at 08:00 UTC (and `workflow_dispatch`),
requesting `id-token: write`, then `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` with
`role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::928413605543:role/github-actions-terraform` and a
`terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` to detect drift. No `aws-access-key-id` anywhere in
the workflow.

## Pattern B — self-hosted autoscaling runners on spot metal

`ejc3/fcvm` needs bare metal (nested KVM, Firecracker), which GitHub's hosted runners can't
provide. So a job queued on `ejc3/fcvm` triggers AWS to launch a spot `*.metal` instance
that registers itself back as a self-hosted runner, serves the job, and is reaped when idle.

**Launch path.** GitHub fires a `workflow_job` webhook → API Gateway HTTP API
(`POST /webhook`, output `runner_webhook_url`) → Lambda `github-runner-webhook`
(`reserved_concurrent_executions = 1`, so concurrent webhooks can't all read the same count
and over-launch). The Lambda verifies the `x-hub-signature-256` HMAC against `WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
acts only on `action == "queued"`, reads the job labels to pick an architecture
(`x64`/`x86_64`/`amd64` → x86, else arm64), and launches a one-time spot instance from a
self-built AMI (`tag:Purpose = github-runner`, newest matching the arch) up to **4 runners
per architecture**. ARM tries `c7gd.metal`→`c7g.metal`; x86 tries
`c5d`/`c5`/`c6i`/`m5d.metal` in order for spot availability. Each instance is tagged with a
`LeaseExpires` 60 minutes out.

**Registration.** The instance's user_data lives in SSM (`/github-runner/user-data`,
Advanced tier, base64 — too big for Lambda's 4 KB env limit). On boot it sets up the box
(btrfs RAID0 over instance NVMe, `/dev/kvm` permissions, IPv6), reads the PAT from SSM
(`/github-runner/pat`, decrypted), exchanges it for a short-lived **registration token** via
`POST /repos/ejc3/fcvm/actions/runners/registration-token`, and runs
`config.sh --url https://github.com/ejc3/fcvm --token <reg> --name runner-<instance-id>
--labels self-hosted,Linux,<ARM64|X64> --unattended --replace`, then installs the runner as
a service. The PAT itself never leaves AWS; what touches `config.sh` is the ephemeral
registration token derived from it.

**Reaping.** A second Lambda, `github-runner-cleanup`, runs every 5 minutes
(`rate(5 minutes)`) and does four things, three of them using the PAT: deregisters GitHub
runners whose instance is gone; renews the lease on busy runners (+60m) and lets idle ones
expire, then terminates and deregisters anything past its lease (instances younger than 10
minutes are skipped so setup isn't interrupted); terminates stray `ami-builder-temp`
instances older than 2 hours (pure EC2, no PAT); and re-checks GitHub for `queued` runs to
retry launches that failed (spot
quota, capacity) — GitHub doesn't redeliver webhooks, so this poll is the retry.

## What crosses the boundary (secrets inventory)

| Secret | Where it lives | Direction | Who reads it | Set / rotated by |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **GitHub PAT** | `/github-runner/pat`, SSM `SecureString` | GitHub-issued, stored in AWS | `github-runner-instance-role`, `github-runner-lambda-role` | manual `put-parameter`; TF stores `placeholder` with `ignore_changes = [value]` |
| **Webhook HMAC** | `github_webhook_secret` tfvar (sensitive) → Lambda env `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | shared, both sides | the webhook Lambda; mirror in GitHub webhook config | `terraform.tfvars`; must match GitHub |
| **Registration token** | minted at boot, never persisted | GitHub-issued, ephemeral | the booting runner only | GitHub API, single use, ~1h TTL |
| **OIDC federation** | no secret — thumbprint pinned on the provider | GitHub asserts, AWS verifies | n/a | trust policy on `github-actions-terraform` |
| **`dev_to_runner` SSH key** | private in SSM `SecureString` `/dev-servers/runner-ssh-key`, public baked into runner `authorized_keys` | AWS-internal (dev box → runner) | dev-server role fetches the private key | TF-generated `tls_private_key` (ED25519) |
| **`fcvm-ec2` keypair** | EC2 keypair `fcvm-ec2` (launch `KeyName`); public key baked into runner `authorized_keys` | AWS-internal (operator → runner) | whoever holds `~/.ssh/fcvm-ec2` (the jumpbox operator) | manual EC2 keypair, never rotated |

The one credential GitHub itself holds for Pattern B is the webhook HMAC. Everything else is
either federated (Pattern A) or stored AWS-side and read through IAM.

## IAM boundaries — who can read what

- **`github-runner-instance-role`** (on the runner): `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` for
  Session Manager, `ssm:GetParameter` scoped to **the PAT parameter only**, and
  `ec2:AssignIpv6Addresses` + `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` (`Resource: *`, for the
  boot-time IPv6 self-assign). A runner cannot read the `dev_to_runner` key or any other
  parameter.
- **`github-runner-lambda-role`** (both Lambdas): logs; EC2
  `Describe`/`Run`/`Stop`/`Terminate`/`CreateTags`; `iam:PassRole`;
  `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`; `ssm:GetParameter` on `/github-runner/*`; and
  `lambda:InvokeFunction` on the webhook function (for the cleanup retry).
- **`github-actions-terraform`** (Pattern A): the read-only + state + AMI-builder set above.
  Its only write into IAM is `PassRole` on `jumpbox-admin-role`.

## Network posture

Runners live in an **isolated VPC** (`10.1.0.0/16`) with no peering to the dev VPC — a
single public `/24` (`10.1.1.0/24`) in **`us-west-1a` only**, internet gateway, dual-stack
IPv6, public IP on launch. That one AZ is the ceiling on the spot fallback: the launcher
walks several instance types but never another subnet/AZ, so a `us-west-1a` capacity gap
fails the launch outright (the cleanup poll is the only retry). The security group allows
**inbound SSH (22) from `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0`** and all egress. There is no inbound path to
the runners except SSH; everything else (webhook, registration, job dispatch) is
runner-initiated outbound to GitHub and the AWS APIs.

## Trade-offs and sharp edges

These are deliberate simplifications for a single-owner CI account, not recommendations to
copy blindly.

- **Webhook auth fails open.** `verify_signature` returns `True` when `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is
  empty, and the tfvar defaults to `""`. With the secret unset, anyone who finds the
  `/webhook` URL and POSTs `{"action":"queued", ...}` can launch metal spot instances — a
  denial-of-wallet path. Set `github_webhook_secret` and confirm it matches the GitHub
  webhook.
- **The "internal" retry bypass is reachable from the public endpoint.** The handler skips
  HMAC verification whenever a request carries `x-internal-invoke: cleanup-retry`. The
  cleanup Lambda uses that to re-enter the launch path, but API Gateway forwards arbitrary
  client headers, so an external caller can set the same header and skip verification up to
  the per-arch cap. Invoking the launch logic directly instead of re-posting through the
  public handler would close it.
- **SSH is open to the internet.** Port 22 from `0.0.0.0/0`/`::/0`, in front of boxes that
  run with `/dev/kvm` exposed and `iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT`. Key-only auth is the only
  control. Convenient for debugging an ephemeral runner; broad as a standing default.
- **The OIDC role is admin-capable by composition.** Its inline policy reads as scoped, but
  `ec2:RunInstances` (`Resource: *`) plus `iam:PassRole` on `jumpbox-admin-role` (which
  carries `AdministratorAccess`) lets a run launch an instance under the admin profile and
  act as admin from there. The `sub` is `repo:ejc3/aws:*` / `repo:ejc3/firepod:*` — any ref,
  not pinned to a protected branch or a GitHub environment.
- **PAT blast radius.** `/github-runner/pat` can register and remove runners on `ejc3/fcvm`;
  any process on a runner that reaches instance-role SSM can read it. Self-hosted runners and
  untrusted PRs don't mix.

## Operating it

- All of Pattern B is gated on `var.enable_github_runner` — flip it to `false` to tear the
  self-hosted side down in one apply.
- Set the PAT out of band (it's never in Terraform state):
  `aws ssm put-parameter --name /github-runner/pat --value ghp_xxx --type SecureString --overwrite`.
- The GitHub webhook points at the `runner_webhook_url` output, event `workflow_job`.
- Pattern A needs nothing in GitHub but the workflow's `permissions: id-token: write` and the
  role ARN — no repo secret to manage.
